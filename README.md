👋 Hi there! I'm a CS graduate from NYIT Manhattan with 2.5 years of hands-on experience as a Full Stack Engineer. I specialize in building scalable applications using Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and the MERN stack. My expertise includes designing secure RESTful APIs, implementing cloud-native architectures with AWS, and maintaining CI/CD pipelines. Currently focused on developing innovative solutions while exploring new technologies. 

## 💻 Projects I Enjoyed
## 👉🏻 AutocodeGrader-AI | Python, CodeLlama, Ollama, React, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, JWT Jan 2024

Developed a comprehensive full-stack solution that revolutionized code grading through the integration of React and CodeLlama LLM, providing students with instant feedback on their assignments. The system's backend infrastructure was built using Express.js and Node.js to create efficient RESTful APIs, enabling seamless client-server communication and data handling. Implemented MongoDB for robust data management of job listings, user profiles, and application data, ensuring optimal scalability and performance as the platform grew. This integrated approach significantly enhanced the learning experience while maintaining high system efficiency.
